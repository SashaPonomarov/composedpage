This is a test task done for Ciklum JS internship.
Parts of the following websites were used to compose a page:
- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/
- https://www.dropbox.com/business
- https://www.invisionapp.com/
- https://www.oculus.com/
- http://www.apple.com/

I used jQuery and [jQuery-menu-aim](https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim) plugin for menu interaction.
Page is adapted to smaller screens. Scss was used too.
